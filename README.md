## Bot

# Market Price Data Collection:
The bot needs to gather price data from a decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Arbitrum. (I suggest hyperliquid/GMX/GNS Network)

- How?
  - APIs/Web3: Use APIs provided by DEXes or Web3 libraries to query smart contracts directly for real-time price data.

# Arbitrage Opportunity Identification:
The bot can continuously compare prices of the same asset across different DEXs.

- Thresholds for Profit:
  - Set thresholds for what constitutes a profitable arbitrage opportunity, accounting for transaction costs.

# Smart Contract Interaction:
Deploy smart contracts or perform transactions that can execute trades.

# Features:
  - Speed:
    - Transactions must be executed rapidly to capitalize on fleeting arbitrage opportunities.
  - Gas Optimization:
    - Optimize for gas fees, as high transaction costs can negate arbitrage profits.
  - Slippage Control:
    - Must account for slippage in high-volume trades.
  - Risk Management:
    - TXs must revert if profit is not secured, therefore no loss in capital.

## Front-End

# Monitoring and Analytics:
Implement basic performance Tracking dashboard to monitor the botâ€™s performance for the front end.

# Control Panel: 
A user interface could potentially manually adjust parameters or pause the bot.
